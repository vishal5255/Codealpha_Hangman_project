My mini project: Hangman Game

#codealpha #internship_project

Hangman is a word guessing game . In this game, the computer picks a secret word.  Your job is to guess that word one letter at a time . 

===========================
How to Play:
===========================
1.When you start the game, you'll see blank spaces showing how many letters are in the secret word.
2.The game gives you some letters as hints to help you guess the word.
3.  You have 6 chances to make wrong guesses.
4.Type one letter at a time to guess the word.
5.If your guess is right, the letter shows up in the word.
6.If your guess is wrong, you lose one chance.
7.You win if you find the all letters in the word before making 6 wrong guesses.
8.You lose if you make 6 wrong guesses before finding the word.
9. After  the game ends, you can choose to play again.
    
The game  is simple and fun. It helps you to learn new words and improve your spelling!

   
============================================
Goals of  the Hangman Game:    
============================================   
- Create a fun word-guessing game for players
- Help players improve their vocabulary and spelling
- Provide an interactive text-based experience
- Make the game accesible for beginers with built-in hints
                                   
========================================
Topics Included: 
==========================================
- Random word selection 
- User input processing
-String manipulation (showing and hiding letters)   
-Game state tracking (guessed letters, remaining attempts)
- Win/loss condition checking     
- Hint system to make gameplay easier

=====================================
Libraries :
=======================================
- random: Helps pick random  words and hint  positions
- time: Creates short pauses to improve game flow  ( seems to be real! :-D )


I use the Logic Behind the Game:
1. The program selects a random word from a predefined  list
2. Some letters are   automatically  revealed as hints
3. The player sees the word with unknown letters shown as blanks
4. When the player guesses a letter, the program checks if it's in the word
5. Correct  guesses  reveal more letters in the word
6. Incorrect guesses  count against the player's limited attempts (6 total)
7.  The game continues until either:
   - The player reveals all letters (win)
   - The player uses all 6 incorrect guesses (lose)
8. After each game, the player can choose to play again

The game balances   challenge with assistance through the hint system, making it suitable for beginners while still being engaging.
